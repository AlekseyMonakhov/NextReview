__Stardew Valley__ is a farm life simulation game developed by Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone. Players
take
the role of a character who inherits their deceased grandfather's dilapidated farm in a place known
as Stardew Valley. The game was released for Windows in February 2016 before being ported to other
platforms. Stardew Valley is open-ended, allowing players to grow crops, raise livestock, fish,
cook, mine, forage, and socialize with the townspeople, including the ability to marry and have
children. It allows up to four players to play online together.

Barone developed Stardew Valley by himself over four and a half years. He was heavily inspired by
the Story of Seasons series, with additions to address some of the shortcomings of those games. He
used it as an exercise to improve his own programming and game design skills. British studio
Chucklefish approached Barone midway through development with the offer to publish the game,
allowing him to focus more on completing it.

Stardew Valley has been cited as one of the greatest video games of all time, with praise directed
towards its music, characters, and relaxing qualities.[not verified in body] Yasuhiro Wada, the
creator of Story of Seasons, also praised the game for retaining the freedom that later entries of
his series had lost. The game was a commercial success, selling over 20 million copies by 2022.8:[["$","h1",null,{"className":"font-bold text-2xl pb-3 font-orbitron","children":"Stardew Valley"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex pb-2 gap-3 items-baseline","children":[["$","p",null,{"children":"2023-10-16"}],["$","$L9",null,{}]]}],["$","$La",null,{"className":"rounded mb-2","src":"/images/stardew-valley.jpg","width":640,"height":360,"alt":"image"}],["$","article",null,{"className":"prose prose-slate max-w-screen-sm","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$b"}}]]
